# 📘 Overview

This repository contains data preparation and preprocessing scripts for the study of 124 commercial lithium-ion batteries (APR18650M1A) manufactured by A123 Systems.
The dataset is designed for exploring early-cycle degradation markers and battery cycle life prediction using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

The repository demonstrates how to convert complex hierarchical .mat files into structured and analysis-ready tabular datasets suitable for Python-based modeling workflows.
